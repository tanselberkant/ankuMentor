# Ankara University Mentor Program Prototype

It is a prototype of a mentor/mentee program designed for Ankara University Students that can help new university students.

This program is a matching program for newly registered students to be paired with "experienced" students, who can share their problems and assist them in solving their problems.

Experienced student data is kept in a hard-coded table. I created a simple copy of a table of 20 students, simulating that this data would be provided on the school side. My aim is for newly registered students to be randomly matched with these students. Then he can go to his own page and view the contact information of the student with whom he is matched, etc.
